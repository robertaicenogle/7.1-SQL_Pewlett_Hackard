# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project we'll use PostgreSQL to analyze Pewlett Hackards employee database in order to help manage employee retirement/turnover. Specifically, we'll determine the number of retiring employees in each title, and identify which employees are able to engage in an employee mentorship program.

- Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
- Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
- Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis

Resources: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin

### Deliverable 3: A written report on the employee database analysis
Summary: 
- Provide high-level responses to the following questions:
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

- Provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
